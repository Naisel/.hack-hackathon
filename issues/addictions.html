            <div class="content-text paragraphs">Addiction is a complex, chronic brain condition influenced by genes and the environment that is characterized by substance use or compulsive actions that continue despite harmful consequences.

For a long time, addiction meant an uncontrollable habit of using alcohol or other drugs. More recently, the concept of addiction has expanded to include behaviors, such as gambling, as well as substances, and even ordinary and necessary activities, such as exercise and eating.
The most common drug addictions are:

                nicotine, found in tobacco
                THC, found in marijuana
                opioid (narcotics), or pain relievers
                cocaine
                coffee or caffeine
                gambling
                anger, as a coping strategy
                food
                technology
                sex
                work</div>

        <div class="symptoms-body paragraphs ">
            <p>Most signs of addiction relate to a person’s impaired ability to maintain self-control. This includes changes that are:

                social, such as seeking out situations that encourage a substance or behavior
                behavioral, such increased secrecy
                health related, such as insomnia or memory loss
                related to personality

Someone with an addition won’t stop their behavior, even if they recognize the problems the addiction is causing. In some cases, they’ll also display a lack of control, like using more than intended.</p>

    <div class="causes">
        <div class="causes-question question borderline">What <span> causes </span>addictions?</div>
        <div class="causes-body paragraphs ">1)The Brain:
                    Some people may try a substance or behavior and never approach it again, while others become addicted. This is partially due to the brain’s frontal lobes. The frontal lobe allows a person to delay feelings of reward or gratification. In addiction, the frontal lobe malfunctions and pleasure is immediate.
                    2)Early usage:
                    early exposure to addictive substances and behaviors play a significant role. Genetics also increase the likelihood of an addiction by about 50 percent,
                    Environment and culture also play a role in how a person responds to a substance or behavior. A lack or disruption in a person’s social support system can lead to substance or behavioral addiction. Traumatic experiences that affect coping abilities can also lead to addictive behaviors.</div>
