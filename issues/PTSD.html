            <div class="content-text paragraphs">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that begins after a traumatic event. That event may involve a real or perceived threat of injury or death.

                    This can include:

                    a natural disaster like an earthquake or tornado
                    military combat
                    physical or sexual assault or abuse
                    an accident</div>

        <div class="symptoms-body paragraphs ">
            <p>Symptoms of PTSD fall into four groups:

                    1.Intrusion:
                            flashbacks where you feel like you relive the event over and over
                            vivid, unpleasant memories of the event
                            frequent nightmares about the event
                            intense mental or physical distress when you think about the event
                    2.Avoidance:
                    Avoidance, as the name implies, means avoiding people, places, or situations that remind you of the traumatic event.

                    3.Arousal and reactivity:
                    trouble concentrating
                    startling easily and having an exaggerated response when you’re startled
                    a constant feeling of being on edge
                    irritability
                    bouts of anger
                    4.Cognition and mood:
                    negative thoughts about yourself
                    distorted feelings of guilt, worry, or blame
                    trouble remembering important parts of the event
                    reduced interest in activities you once loved

        In addition, people with PTSD may experience depression and panic attacks..</p>

        <div class="causes-body paragraphs ">PTSD starts in people who’ve been through or witnessed a traumatic event like a natural disaster, military combat, or assault. Most people who experience one of these events have no problems afterward, but a small percentage develop PTSD.

Trauma may cause actual changes to the brain.</div>

    <div class="cure">
        <div class="cure-question question borderline">How are anxiety disorders <span>treated?</span></div>
        <div class="cure-body paragraphs ">Most probably the treatment includes therapy, medication, or a combination of the two treatments.

Antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and sleep aids may help relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety.</div>
