        <div class="content-body">
            <div class="content-text paragraphs">Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).

When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.

Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.

Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy).</div>

        <div class="causes-question question borderline">What <span> causes </span>bipolar disorders?</div>
        <div class="causes-body paragraphs ">The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as:

                Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes.
                Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder.</div>

The following herbs and supplements may help stabilize your mood and reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder when combined with medication and therapy:

Omega-3. Some 2016 researchTrusted Source suggests that taking an omega-3 supplement may help with symptoms of bipolar I. A 2012 studyTrusted Source found this was particularly helpful with depressive symptoms.

Rhodiola rosea. A 2013 reviewTrusted Source suggests this plant may help with moderate depression, so it could help treat depression associated with bipolar disorder.

S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). SAMe is an amino acid supplement that can help easeTrusted Source symptoms of major depression and other mood disorders.</div>
